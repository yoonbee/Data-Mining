# Data-Mining

### DM4 - DBSCAN
A time-series gene expression data set is provided to discover gene sets with co-expression patterns (similar expressions during a given time range). The co-expressed genes are likely to have the same cellular functions. Implement the DBSCAN algorithm as a density-based approach. Use Euclidean distance to measure distance between data points. Use epsilon = 1.0 and 2.0 and min_pts = 2, 4, and 6. In output files, show each cluster at each line starting with the size of the cluster, for example, "6: {1, 24, 56, 139, 285, 471}".
