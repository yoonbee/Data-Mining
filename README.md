# Data-Mining

## Project
Three categories of graph clustering algorithms have been discussed in class: density-based algorithms, partition-based algorithms, and hierarchical algorithms. Develop your own algorithm that is technically sound. When a protein-protein interaction network is used as input, the output clusters represent potential protein complexes. Justify that your own algorithm has competitive performance. Use the f-measure to evaluate the clustering results by comparing to protein complex data provided. Compute an f-score for each output cluster by selecting the maximum f-score to a protein complex, and average the f-scores of all output clusters. Compare the average f-scores between your algorithm and two previous algorithms implemented in Programming Assignments. If you have a team project, compare the algorithms using an additional cluster validation method for graph clustering. (But, do not use incident matrices.)
