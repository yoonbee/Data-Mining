# Data-Mining

### DM3 - k-Means
A time-series gene expression data set is provided to discover gene sets with co-expression patterns (similar expressions during a given time range). The co-expressed genes are likely to have the same cellular functions. Implement k-Means with k=10 to find 10 clusters of genes. Use Euclidean distance to measure distance between data objects. In an output file, show each cluster at each line starting with the size of the cluster, for example, "6: {1, 24, 56, 139, 285, 471}".
