### DM1 - Apriori algorithm
We can discover frequent gene sets from input data of functional categories and annotating genes. A frequent gene set means a set of genes that work for the same cellular functions frequently. Implement the Apriori algorithm to read the data set provided and find frequent gene sets with minimum support of 3.5%. Your program will print the frequent gene sets with size greater than or equal to 2 into an output file. It will show the support of each frequent gene set at each line, for example, {YAL005c, YBR044c} 3.8% support.


### DM2 - Charm algorithm
We can discover frequent closed gene sets from input data of functional categories and annotating genes. A frequent closed gene set means a set of genes frequently occurring in the same cellular functions, which does not have any super-set with the same support. Implement the Charm algorithm to read the data set provided and find frequent closed gene sets with minimum support of 3.5%. Your program will print the frequent closed gene sets with size greater than or equal to 2 into an output file. It will show the support of each frequent closed gene set at each line, for example, {YAL005c, YBR044c} 3.8% support
