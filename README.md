### DM5 - Comparing Accuracy of Clustering Results by Incident Matrices
A cluster validation algorithm assesses the quality of clustering results. Using the Jaccard index of two incident matrices of the output clusters and the ground-truth clusters, measure the accuracy of the clustering results from k-Means where k = 10 and DBSCAN where epsilon = 1.0 and 2.0 and min_pts = 2, 4, and 6. Your program will take two input files: one has the ground-truth clusters and the other is an output file on Assignment 3 or 4. Your program will print a Jaccard index value to the screen.
