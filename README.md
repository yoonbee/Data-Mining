### DM7 - Hierarchical Algorithm
A protein-protein interaction data set is provided to discover sets of proteins densely connected each other. The densely connected proteins are likely to have the same cellular functions. Implement the top-down hierarchical algorithm by least common neighbors. In Step-1, iteratively remove an edge whose two ending vertices have the smallest Jaccard index of the sets of their neighbors until the graph is disconnected. In Step-2, if the graph is disconnected into two subgraphs, then measure the density of each subgraph. If the subgraph meets the density threshold of 0.5 (50%), then return the subgraph as a cluster. Otherwise, apply the iterative edge removal of Step-1 to the subgraph recursively. In Step-3, repeat Step-2 until all vertices are returned. In an output file, show each cluster of size greater than 2 at each line in the format of the size and each protein in the cluster, for example, "3: {YBR160W YDR224C YPL231W}". Print the clusters in a decreasing order of their size.
