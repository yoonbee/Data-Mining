### DM2 - Charm algorithm
We can discover frequent closed gene sets from input data of functional categories and annotating genes. A frequent closed gene set means a set of genes frequently occurring in the same cellular functions, which does not have any super-set with the same support. Implement the Charm algorithm to read the data set provided and find frequent closed gene sets with minimum support of 3.5%. Your program will print the frequent closed gene sets with size greater than or equal to 2 into an output file. It will show the support of each frequent closed gene set at each line, for example, {YAL005c, YBR044c} 3.8% support
